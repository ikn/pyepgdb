pyepgdb documentation
================================================================================

This is the reference documentation for pyepgdb, a Python 3 library for
parsing epgdb (v2) files produced by `Tvheadend <https://tvheadend.org/>`_.

- For information on what that means, see the
  `project home page <http://ikn.org.uk/lib/pyepgdb>`_.
- For installation instructions, refer to the readme file distributed with the
  source code.

Tvheadend stores the epgdb file at :file:`~/.hts/tvheadend/epgdb.v2` by default.
This file only seems to be updated when Tvheadend restarts - see
`tvheadend-safe-restart <http://ikn.org.uk/tool/tvheadend-safe-restart>`_ for
help with that.
